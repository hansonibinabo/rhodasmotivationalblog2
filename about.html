                <p>I am Rhoda Amapakabo, a graduate of Sociology from the University of Jos, Nigeria. From a family of four, with a loving, intelligent and understanding father and a selfless, over-caring and loving mother, who is late. A lover of Christ and all that concerns Him. Born and raised in the city of Portharcourt. <p>rhodasmotivationalblog was birthed in moments of challenges and emotional break down. It started some months after I lost my mum (May Her Gentle Soul Rest in Peace). In fact, after months of emotional break down and all. To find a source of encouragement and solace to pull through, I decided to search for words of encouragement, which I began writing in pieces of paper, later in a book then the idea of a blog popped up to encourage people live through life's challenges and difficulties. </p>

                    Furthermore, I am a writer with a published book, “The Beauty and Power of a Purposeful Life.” This  was a vision I got towards the end of 2021. <br>I started writing in 2023 and hoped I would finish in three months which I actually did,  but God had a different plan for the book. He wanted more so I continued writing, finished and published it in 2023. The book is meant to inspire and motivate people pursue and live their dreams and purposes in life despite the prevailing circumstance they may find themselves in. <br>
                    The book is also meant to let everyone know that they have a purpose - a God-given purpose to pursue and live in life and to help them discover this purpose they are meant to live.
                    
                    <p>Finally, I have a TV show titled “Rhoda's Motivational Talk Show”. Its a TV show created to have guest speakers come speak about their experiences in the pursuit of their dreams, in the areas of career, family, relationships, businesses, etc. This is done in a bid  to inspire and motivate people live their dreams, to encourage them that they too can pursue and live their dreams.</p>
                    
                    </p>       I am passionate in motivating people live through life's challenges, having been through so many. Everyone of us can live through life's challenges, if only we see the big and beautiful picture after the storm. There is always a new dawn after the darkest of nights.<br> 
               <p>At <span>rhodasmotivationalblog,</span> we try to provide quality contents meant to encourage our readers live life through every challenge of life. Every content in <span>rhodasmotivationalblog,</span> has 100 percent originality. Life is worth living.</p>

                    <h1>THINGS WILL EVENTUALLY FALL INTO PLACE</h1>
                    <p>It can sometimes be frustrating to see the successes of others that seem so effortless or like it was handed over to them on a silver platter yet for you it seems more of struggles and sometimes, even after the struggles, things still don’t fall into place as expected, or they seem like they never would.
